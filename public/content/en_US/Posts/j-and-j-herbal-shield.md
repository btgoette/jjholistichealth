It is common knowledge that having a robust immune system is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. With Covid-19 still at large, a strong immune system is critical.

While there’s no guarantee that a good immune system will prevent you from catching the virus, it surely helps the fight against it. With more variants of the virus popping up almost every month, the need to take good care of your immune system is more important than ever.

There are many different things you can do to boost your immunity, including:

  - __Eating a healthy, balanced diet__ - a diet high in fruits and vegetables, as well as the right portions of proteins, carbs, and fats, are essential for your immune system
  - __Getting plenty of exercise__ - experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week.
  - __Maintaining a healthy weight__ - it is recommended to aim for a BMI of 25 and lower to keep your immune system working effectively.
  - __Good quality sleep__ - set a sleep routine that gives you at least 6 hours of sleep and stick to it.
  - __Quitting smoking__ - if you smoke, you can get support to help you stop.

## J&J Holistic Nutritional Therapy Herbal Shield

Is another great addition to your immune boosting routine.

Like the Army, our immune system is a highly complex defensive network of individual units that work together to combat disease-causing agents such as bacteria, viruses, and other ‘enemies’.

Since it is made up of many parts acting as one, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to boosting the immune system. Nonetheless, using the right ingredients, this network can be strengthened to run more efficiently and fight most diseases. The J&J Holistic Nutritional Therapy Herbal Shield is curated from powerful herbs with the highest quality ingredients to ensure that you are getting the right amount of immune support every day.
