The pituitary gland is a master gland that rarely gets the attention it deserves. Well, that is until there is a snag in its performance. The pituitary gland plays an incredibly important role in your overall wellbeing because it controls the functions of all other endocrine glands. This often-overlooked gland inconspicuously and consistently toils away, working to keep you healthy around the clock. As such, we would like to take some time today to take a closer look at this unsung hero, understand its role and value in the human body, and look into several herbs that promote its health.

## What is the Pituitary Gland?

The pituitary gland is the smallest endocrine gland; it’s about the size of a pea or a pinto bean, weighs in at only 5 grams, and is located at the base of the hypothalamus. If you could see your brain in a mirror, it’d be the tiny part dangling from the bottom of your brain.

Despite its small size, the pituitary gland ironically controls the functions of all other endocrine glands. Here is a picture for better visualization:

## What Does the Pituitary Gland Do?

As mentioned above, your pituitary gland acts as the control center of your endocrine system and manages numerous other glands, including the thyroid gland, the anti-diuretic gland, and even the testes and ovaries as well.

This master gland further produces and discharges hormones that regulate the performance of endocrine glands while simultaneously communicating signals from your mind to your body.

Due to its supervisory role, the pituitary gland therefore naturally affects the functions of several critical body systems, including your energy level, metabolism, blood pressure, sexual maturation, growth reproduction, and much more.

The following are some of the hormones produced and stored by the pituitary system along with the role each one plays in your body:

### Human Growth Hormone (HGH)

The Human Growth Hormone serves to maintain a healthy growth rate in children and ensures a healthy body composition by regulating fat distribution, bone, and muscle mass in adults.

### Adrenocorticotropic Hormone

The Adrenocorticotropic Hormone prompts the adrenal gland to release a steroid or stress hormone called cortisol, which helps maintain healthy glucose and blood pressure levels in your body.

### Luteinizing Hormone

The luteinizing hormone stimulates the production of sex hormones by acting on the testes and ovaries. This hormone also plays an important role in egg and sperm maturity as well as in maintaining a healthy reproductive system.

### Prolactin

Prolactin is a hormone that triggers the production of milk in nursing women while also contributing to fertility and sex hormone levels.

### Oxytocin

Working closely with the Prolactin hormone, Oxytocin aids in the secretion of milk during breastfeeding and also stimulates uterine contractions during labor.

### Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)

As the name suggests, the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone helps the thyroid gland produce hormones that regulate your metabolism, energy level, nervous system, and growth development.

### Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH)

The Anti-Diuretic Hormone, on the other hand, aids in the regulation of water balance and blood pressure in your body.

## Why is Proper Pituitary Support so Important?

When you look at all the systems and processes that the Pituitary Gland regulates, it’s easy to see its value, and it’s equally ironic that it doesn’t get more attention. This gland singlehandedly oversees the growth and development of, essentially, your entire body and maintains normal hormone levels that work to promote your overall health.

So, here’s a quick summary of everything we have covered so far on why the Pituitary Gland is so important. This is why you should pay attention to it and take action to support it properly. The Pituitary Gland is involved in: 

 - Maintaining a healthy growth rate
 - Regulating blood pressure
 - Production of breast milk
 - Fertility and sex hormones
 - Thyroid gland function
 - Metabolic function
 - Water balance regulation
 - Bone and muscle mass function

## Best Pituitary Herbs to Support a Healthy Pituitary Gland

Now that you understand its importance, you’re probably wondering how you can keep your pituitary gland as healthy as it should be. You will be glad to know that certain herbs provide a natural solution to this and keep this master gland in proper working order – and you healthy!

Here are our 6 favorite pituitary herbs:

### 1. Bladder Wrack

Now that you understand its importance, you’re probably wondering how you can keep your pituitary gland as healthy as it should be. You will be glad to know that certain herbs provide a natural solution to this and keep this master gland in proper working order – and you healthy!

### 2. Kelp

Kelp provides an excellent, all-natural source of iodine, which is necessary for proper pituitary and thyroid function. As a natural source of iodine, Kelp aids the Pituitary Gland in regulating body temperature and metabolism.

As an added benefit, since Kelps promotes a healthy metabolism, you can add it to your list of weight loss herbs. Additionally, Kelp is a natural diuretic and is therefore great for shedding water and toxins from the body.

### 3. Pau d’Arco

Pau d’Arco is a herb that finds its origins in South and Central America. The herb serves to aid the Pituitary Gland in maintaining hormonal balance, especially as pertains to sex hormones. In addition to this, Pau d’Arco serves as an immune modulator, helping the body create a sufficient amount of immune-boosting white blood cells.
### 4. Nettle

Nettle is beneficial for reversing and preventing iodine deficiency. Nettle works as a natural kidney and thyroid tonic. This herb is also a powerful adrenal ally, consistently working to prevent adrenal fatigue caused by the secretion of too much cortisol (stress hormone).

### 5. Irish Moss

Irish Moss, also known as Sea Moss, contains a large amount of iodine and other trace minerals that help the thyroid produce T3 and T4 hormones. Irish Moss is also the only known plant source of the Thyroid Hormone and, therefore, it’s a natural remedy for many thyroid-related issues.

### 6. Barberry Root

Like Bladder Wrack, Barberry Root helps reverse hypothyroidism and also balances endocrine hormones in general. Barberry Root aids in balancing the thyroid hormone as well as adrenal and pancreatic hormones.

We were so impressed by the efficacy of these pituitary herbs that we put them together and formulated an organic, 100% all-natural, pituitary supplement.

Our supplement incorporates all of these powerful herbs, geared at promoting the overall health of your pituitary gland. When combined with other measures such as proper diet and stress management, targeted pituitary herbs can help you keep your pituitary gland in tip-top shape.
