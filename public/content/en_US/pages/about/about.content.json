We recognize that disease is complex, that’s why we focus on the concept of bio-individuality; where every individual has a specific genetic, ancestral, and geographic makeup that determines their own unique nutritional needs. Many nutrition programs fail because they take a “one size fits all” approach that ignores bio-individuality."
