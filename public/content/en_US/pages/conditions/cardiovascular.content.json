The issue may not be the amount of fat or oil, but the quality of the fats eaten; Omega 3 essential fatty acids may be cardio-protective. Consuming hydrogenated oil is dangerous to the heart (among other things). Not many people pay attention to sugar and refined foods. Refined sugar and flour may play an important role in increasing cholesterol. Anticholesterol medications work by suppressing a liver enzyme, HMG CoA reductase. Increasing insulin increases the activity of this enzyme, so eating sugar can have an unfavorable effect on cholesterol. Sugar and refined grains also increase the growth of yeast and other dysbiotic organisms in the gut. Bile salts can be deconjugated by these organisms and turned into bile acids; this may trigger the production of cholesterol by the liver. Epidemiologic studies show that native populations have increased heart disease when exposed to the Western diet, but their fat consumption doesn’t go up; their consumption of refined carbohydrates does."
