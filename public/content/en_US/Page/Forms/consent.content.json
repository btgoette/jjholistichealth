Nutritional therapy is designed to improve your health but is not designed to treat any specific disease or medical condition. Reaching the goal of optimum health, absent other non-nutritional complicating factors, requires a sincere commitment from you, lifestyle changes, and a positive attitude. A Nutritional Therapist is trained to evaluate your nutritional needs and make recommendations of dietary change and nutritional supplements. A Nutritional Therapist is not trained to provide medical diagnoses, and no comment or recommendation should be construed as being a medical diagnosis. Since every human being is unique, we cannot guarantee any specific result from our programs."

A Nutritional Therapist is not a substitute for your family physician or other appropriate healthcare providers. A Nutritional Therapist is not trained nor licensed to diagnose or treat pathological conditions, illnesses, injuries, or diseases."

Nutritional therapy may be a beneficial adjunct to more traditional care, and it may also alter your need for medication, so you must always keep your physician informed of changes in your nutritional program."

                    "p": "COMMUNICATION: Every client is an individual, and it is not possible to determine in advance how your system will react to the supplements you need. It is sometimes necessary to adjust your program as we proceed until your body can accept products geared to correct the imbalance. It is your responsibility to do your part by using your nutrition guidelines, exercise your body and mind sufficiently to bring your emotions into a positive balance, eat a proper diet, get plenty of rest, and learn about nutrition. You must stay in contact with the Nutritional Therapist, so we can let you know what is happening and the best course of action."
