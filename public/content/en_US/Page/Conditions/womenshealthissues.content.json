Excess estrogen can cause problems by reducing the production of serotonin, decreasing the action of vitamin B6, causing other hormone imbalances, reducing endorphin levels, creating breast tenderness, and adversely affecting liver function. Excess estrogen can be caused by a deficiency of B vitamins, lack of sulfur‐containing amino acids, stasis of bile (due to thickening—commonly called “sluggish liver). By the same token, biliary stasis, and poor liver function may cause excess estrogen through poor detoxification of estrogen. The thyroid or adrenal glands may be involved, or there may be problems with bowel flora (dysbiosis) or hidden allergies."
