    "description": "Words cannot express how great I feel since I have been a client of J &amp; J Holistic Nutritional Therapy. I have been dealing with Spinal Stenosis since 2012. Following the recommendations both nutritional, dietary and with the introduction of essential oils and CDB oils l no longer take pain meds or my antidepressant. I was taking far too many prescribed and over the counter medications. Since adopting the life style changes and eliminating foods that I never knew I was allergic to Iâ€™am literally pain free, no Advil, Alieve, Benadryl. My headaches are gone.",
