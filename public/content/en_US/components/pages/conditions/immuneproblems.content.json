For instance, chemicals in the environment, genetics, heavy metals, drug therapies, dysbiosis, liver problems, intestinal permeability, and poor diet can burden our immune systems. Although these conditions come with a distinct underlying cause that must be addressed, direct support of the immune system is often necessary.",

The thymus reflex is on the 5th intercostal space, next to the sternum. The spleen reflex is on the left 7th intercostal space. Simply check the reflex for tenderness. Then have the client hold the nutrient in his or her mouth and see if the tenderness decreases. If the reflex becomes less tender, then the nutrient is appropriate.",
